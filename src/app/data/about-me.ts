    introduction: `
        My recent history is 2 years in Technical Support, 3 years in System Administration and now 
        18 months in Development. I most recently completed a one-year contractor position following 
        company training. Work included SQL query development for SQL Server and Oracle, Test Automation 
        using Selenium/Cucumber (POM model), and framework analysis/development for functionality, performance 
        and efficiency. I am no longer under contract and looking forward to further building my experience and 
        skill set.
